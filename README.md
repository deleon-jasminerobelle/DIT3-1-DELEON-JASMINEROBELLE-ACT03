1. What design choices did you make (colors, fonts, layout)?

In designing the application, I chose to use simple and light colors that are more comfortable and accessible to the eyes of the users. This color scheme helps create a clean and calm interface, making it easier to focus on the content and functions of the app. I used clear and readable fonts with consistent sizes to maintain simplicity and professionalism in the overall design. The layout was organized in a straightforward and structured way, ensuring that each element—such as buttons, icons, and text—is easy to locate and navigate.

2. How did you ensure the screen is user-friendly and accessible?

To make the screen user-friendly and accessible, I focused on clarity, simplicity, and ease of navigation. I made sure that buttons and text were properly sized and spaced to avoid clutter and confusion. Icons were also used to help users quickly understand the purpose of each feature. I selected light color tones with good contrast to ensure that text remains readable on any background. Additionally, I followed basic UI/UX principles, ensuring that users could easily perform actions without needing prior instructions.

3. What would you improve if this were a real app?

If this were a real app, I would improve it by adding more interactive and visually appealing elements such as animations or transitions to make the interface livelier without sacrificing simplicity. I would also conduct usability testing to gather feedback from real users and further enhance accessibility features, such as dark mode options and larger text settings for users with visual difficulties. Lastly, I would optimize the layout for different screen sizes to ensure a smooth and consistent experience across all Android devices.
